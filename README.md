Horiseon Website Code Refactoring

## Code Refactoring Guidelines 

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. employed a marketing agency to update their website. We were employed to ensure that the update held to current semantics and accessibility standards. The standards and semantics were reviewed and corrected. Below is an overview of the changes provided to the source code from the marketing agency. Specific changes are documented in comments through the HTML and CSS code. 

No changes, per the marketing agency's request, were made to the website content or layout. 


## Acceptance Criteria Requirements:

    Semantic HTML elements are found in the source code (given that accessibility standards are met).

    Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning when viewing the HTML structure.

    Image elements were provided accessible alt attributes.

    Heading attributes fall in sequential order. 

    The title element has a concise, descriptive title.

## Criteria Determination: Standards Satisfactorily Met 

Corrected code provided has met the acceptance criteria per request. Changes made included: 

    The addition of HTML5 semantics including: header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer. 
    
    Elements were rearranged to follow logical structure and correspond to the order presented on the page. 
    
    All image elements except the background image were provided accessible alt attributes (current standards do not require an alt attribute for background images as they are considered a part of the styling). 
    
    Heading attributes were corrected to ensure they followed sequential order. 
    
    The title used referenced the company more descriptive and specific reference.
