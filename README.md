Horiseon Website Code Refactoring

## Code Refactoring Guidelines 

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. employed a marketing agency to update their website. We were employed to ensure that the update held to current semantics and accessibility standards. The standards and semantics were reviewed and corrected. Below is a overview of the changes provided to the source code from the marketing agency. Specific changes are documented in comments through the HTML and CSS code. 

No changes, per the marketing agency's request, were made to the website content or layout. 


## Semantic Markup Language Criteria Reviewed: 

Changes made included the addition of document structure: header, nav, article, aside, and footer. Heading tags were corrected to follow current standards. No media was inculded in the page provided for review and no corrections were made to the correlation tags (except to update the document structure with the nav tag).


The changes above were determined by review of the following four areas to ensure that HTML5 semantics per HTML.com and W3schools.com were adhered too:

Document structure tags

Textual meaning tags

Media type tags

Correlation tags
